Capture Traffic from a Different Account
========================================

To capture traffic from accounts other than the current user (for example, ASP.NET on IIS or a Windows Service), configure that process to use the Fiddler proxy.

For Example
----------------

[Configure .NET Applications][1]

[Configure WinHTTP Applications][2]

[1]: ./ConfigureDotNETApp
[2]: ./ConfigureWinHTTPApp
