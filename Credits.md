#Fiddler Credits

Fiddler is a now maintained by Telerik, supported by feedback from many members of the [community](http://groups.google.com/group/httpfiddler/). Beyond the ~40K lines of C# code, Fiddler depends on the work of a number of other companies and individuals:

* Some of Fiddler's icons were generously provided under Creative Commons from the [FatCow.com free icon set](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).
* Fiddler is installed using the excellent and freeware [NSIS Installer](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download).
* Fiddler's HexView inspector is based around an early fork of what is now the [HexEditor control](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hexbox/), Copyright (c) 2011 Bernhard Elbl - Licensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
* Fiddler's JSON support (used for HTTPArchive import/export and elsewhere) is based on a sample ©2008 Patrick van Bergen - Licensed under the MIT License.
* Fiddler's JavaScript formatting code is based on a sample [©2012 Jonathan Wood](http://www.blackbeltcoder.com/Articles/strings/a-javascript-formatter) - Licensed under the [Microsoft Public License](http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/licenses.mspx).

[Fiddler was produced with the help of a number of commercial tools](http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/licenses.mspx)

* [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/) is used for recording the newer [Fiddler Demo Videos](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler/help/video/).
* Fiddler uses the commercial Xceed Libraries for compressing SAZ files and compressing/decompressing web traffic.
* Red-Gate Developer Tools have been used for finding memory leaks and opportunities for optimization.
* The [Quantum Whale Editor.NET](http://www.qwhale.net/products/editor.htm) component is used for the SyntaxView Inspector and FiddlerScript Editors.
* Fiddler is built using [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/).
* The primary Fiddler websites are hosted by [CrystalTech](http://www.crystaltech.com/), but to avoid a 400GB monthly bandwidth cap, download hosting is by [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/).
* WikiHosting is purchased from [WikiDot](http://www.wikidot.com/).
* Domain names and HTTPS certificate are purchased from [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/).
